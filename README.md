## 🐍 Data Analysis with Python

This section of the project focuses on **data processing, analysis, and visualization using Python**.  
The goal is to transform raw data into structured insights that help understand patterns, trends, and key indicators related to the dataset.

Python was used not only for visualization, but also for **data cleaning, transformation, and analytical computation**.

### ⚙️ Analysis Workflow

The analysis process includes:

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values  
   - Formatting data types  
   - Removing inconsistencies  

2. **Data Transformation**
   - Aggregating data  
   - Creating calculated metrics  
   - Grouping variables for comparison  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identifying trends and distributions  
   - Comparing categories  
   - Detecting patterns and anomalies  

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Converting analysis results into visual form  
   - Making insights easier to interpret
